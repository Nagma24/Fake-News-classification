# Fake-News-classification
This project is associated with fake news detection
Problem Statement:
Fake news encapsulates pieces of news that may be hoaxes and is generally spread
through social media and other online media. This is often done to further or impose
certain ideas and is often achieved with political agendas.
The problem of widespread fake news on social media platforms can be tackled using
fake news classifiers which predict and tag the news for better accuracy. Solution should
be able to forecast real-time applications. It should be scalable and can handle enormous
datasets with ease.

Motivation:
Some news segments lead to a widespread dis-information, mis-information,
mal-information which can lead to a catastrophic result for news platforms, individuals,
race etc. It's inexpensive to supply news online and far faster and easier to propagate
through social media large volumes of faux news, i.e., those news articles with
intentionally false information, are produced online for a spread of purposes, like
financial and political gain.
In this project, we aim to build a Naive Bayes Classifier to detect fake news based on the
title of the article. This is achieved through using different types of training datasets to
refine the algorithms. The trained model will help us in identifying fake news which can be used as a filter to show which news is fake on social media. Thus, allowing users to
decide what they want to believe.
